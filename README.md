## C Programming ATM Machine System 
### When I was in my third semester of university, the project was completed successfully. After learning the C programming, all are applied in this project, which is necessary for the project requirement.I use the file system to save the data and fetch the data from the file; that's why users can complete their transactions perfectly and save their transactional history.
